        <p>I'm a senior at Columbia University with a background in video journalism and the social sciences.</p>
        <p>My interest in journalism was sparked at the beginning of my first year in 
        college. Working for the Columbia Daily Spectator, I eventually became the executive 
        producer for the 148th Managing Board, directing Spectator's video content. In 
        January, 2024, I reported on a hazardous chemical being sprayed at a pro-Palestinian 
        rally, and in April, I covered the encampments, occupation of Hamilton Hall, and 
        the related arrests. My reporting was cited by several national media outlets, 
        including the New York Times, and my footage appeared on PBS Frontline.</p>
        <p>When I'm not reporting, I spend much of my (productive) time in class and doing 
        school work. My classes in security studies, political economy, and statistics are 
        those that excite me most. Among my favorite courses at university were three research 
        seminars I took in the spring of my junior year, which culminated in 20-25 page 
        term papers. The methodology, prose, and argument of these papers were all pretty basic, 
        but they got me interested and invested in doing research. Currently, I'm writing my 
        senior thesis on attitudes toward nuclear weapons in India. Using a survey experiment
        fielded via Amazon MTurk, I'm testing how support for nuclear use changes when people are
        exposed to pacifistic, national identity-based arguments.</p>
        <p>While at university, I have worked for organizations spanning journalism 
        and advocacy. In the summer going into my junior year, I worked for PEN America, 
        researching how journalists and writers can protect themselves against hate, harassment, 
        and intimidation online. Throughout the 2024-25 academic year, I served as an editorial and 
        production intern at NBC News.
        </p>
        <p>
        Looking toward future careers, I plan on applying the research skills I have developed at 
        University with the tenacity and resolve I had to build as a student journalist. This could lead me to a a job journalism, academia, public service,
        or any other field that's gripping and fulfilling. If you know of an opportunity that I'd be well-suited for,
